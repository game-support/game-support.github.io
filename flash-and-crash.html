        <h1> What's the point of this game? </h1>
        <p>You destroy things in virtual world so you can stay calm in the real world. Also revenge! ^_^</p>

        <h1> Are there any in-game real-money purchases? </h1>
        <p>No. You buy this game only once, and don't pay anything later. Updates are free, no ads, no nothing.</p>

        <h1> How do I play this game? </h1>
        <p>After the game loads, you get to see the starting screen. When you tap the logo,
        game transitions to the level selection screen. Here you can select a level to play. Levels, which are not available yet, have lock signs on them.</p>
        <p>When you select a level, actual gameplay starts. In order to complete any level, you need to earn at least 50 points (number of points earned
        can be seen in the top-right corner of the screen, near the spark symbol). You can do so by destroying things on the level. But be careful! Some things
        are not meant to be destroyed! Yeah, you also have limited time to complete level (you can see timer ticking in the top-right corner of the screen, near the score).
        And one more thing: if you don't wanna wait, you can finish any level right away by tapping the score or timer: you'll get straight to the post-game screen.</p>
        <p>Oh, by the way, you can pause the game by pressing the button at the top-left corner of the screen.</p>

        <p>If you pause the game, you will see two additional buttons, which do the following things: restart the current level, or
        get you back to the level selection screen.</p>

        <h1> Can I upgrade weapons? </h1>
        <p>Yes, you can! First, you need to complete some levels and earn in-game points. Each level gives you from 50 to 100 points depending on your score.
        When you get enough points, go to the in-game shop (accessed from level selection screen) and select the weapon you want to upgrade.</p>

        <h1> I've got the "Your device ran out of memory" screen. What do I do? </h1>
        <p>Don't panic, nothing bad happened. There is a number of reasons why you could see this screen. The most probable one is that
        "your device ran out of memory". You'll need to close other running apps, and tap the screen to reload the level.</p>

        <h1> YOUR GAME DOES NOT WORK! IT DOES NOT EVEN START! AARGH!!! </h1>
        <p>Now that's really strange. There might be the following reasons for this to happen:
        <ul>
                <li>Some bug in app code. But bear in mind that this app has been tested and works even on iPhone 4S.</li>
                <li>You have a lot of other apps running and not enough RAM left. This game needs 100Mb free RAM to run.</li>
                <li>Your storage became corrupted. It happens with Flash memory sometimes. But still is very improbable.</li>
        </ul>
        As a rule of thumb, you should always check what apps are running on your device. They consume resources: CPU power, RAM... Yeah...
        </p>

        <h1> I've got other issues with the game. </h1>
        <p>If this Q &amp; A didn't help you, you can send ask your question here.</p>
